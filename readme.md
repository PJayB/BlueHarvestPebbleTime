Star Wars Watchface for Pebble Time
==============================

Version 0.8

This is a watchface for the Pebble Time (https://www.pebble.com/).

It displays spacecraft as 3D rendered holograms, hooked up to the accelerometer, in addition to basic spacecraft information. Tilt your watch to see a different angle! The craft change randomly each minute, and a new statistic appears every eight seconds.

**This is alpha software. You will experience poor battery life and occasional crashes.**
